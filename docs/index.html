                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from Solvay, I started my career in audit, where I learned to dive into
                    numbers, work under pressure, and communicate clearly with all kinds of stakeholders. That
                    experience gave me a solid understanding of how companies really operate, and how smart
                    financial insight can drive real decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, I decided to combine this financial expertise with a more hands-on, commercial
                    approach in consulting. I took on responsibilities as a business manager, learning how to
                    manage projects, build strong client relationships, coordinate teams, and solve complex
                    problems, all while keeping people at the center of everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, with Bridgi, our mission is clear: put people back at the center of staffing. we aim to
                    eliminate unnecessary complexity, inflated fees, and transactional processes. We work as a
                    trusted partner for companies, providing long-term support and guidance. Every aspect is
                    transparent, from pricing to candidate selection. Profiles are carefully screened and
                    assessed not just for skills, but for personality and cultural fit, with continuous follow-up to
                    ensure success.
